Hi Team,

I hope you are well.

I would really like to thank you for the opportunity to take a code test for your company. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to complete it due to my lack of knowledge in Vue.js. I have never worked with or used Vue before, but I applied all the knowledge I had to this project. Vue has some similarities with React, so I was able to manage a bit.

Here’s a step-by-step of what I wanted to do but couldn’t:

    I fetched the users from the API and added them to the USERLIST component.
    I wanted to pass the details of these users to the USERDETAILS component via PARAMS, but unfortunately, I couldn’t figure out how to do it with Vue Router.
    Another problem I encountered was with creating a dynamic layout. In React, we use <OUTLET />, but I couldn’t figure out how to implement something similar in Vue. I tried using <router-view>, but it didn’t work. As a result, the data in USERDETAILS is hard-coded.

I was also unable to add users to the API using the POST method. I have some tools that I used to test the API, but they didn’t work in Vue.



I appreciate your time and this opportunity.
